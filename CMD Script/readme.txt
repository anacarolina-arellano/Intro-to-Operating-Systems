This is a Shell script that creates a folder named "Build" and copies 
the files "StudioPoseOLAF.obj" and "CatchingAHorse.zip" into the
created folder.


## Synopsis
---------------
This project consist of a shell script that by being runned in the same 
folder in which the files "StudioPoseOLAF.obj" and "CatchingAHorse.zip" 
are located, it creates a new folder named "Builds" and copies those 
documents into it.


## Contributors 
---------------
I first ran the command: grep -c "v " StudioPoseOLAF.obj in my Mac's console [Linux] 
and I got the result correctly. Nonetheless, when I tried to do it in the windows
console, I noticed that the grep command was not included in its library, therefore, 
I reached to Stackoverflow to check if there was any other command that could replace
grep, what I found was the command "find" and with the option /C I was able to get
the same result as with "grep -c "v " StudioPoseOLAF.obj"
